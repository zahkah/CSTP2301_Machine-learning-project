## Introduction
The maritime shipping industry is a cornerstone of global trade, but forecasting its operations can be challenging due to noisy and incomplete data. This project addresses this challenge by:
- Simulating noisy datasets to mimic real-world scenarios.
- Building robust machine learning models for reliable predictions.
- Providing insights to improve operational efficiency and decision-making.

## Features
- **Noise Simulation**: Adds synthetic noise to the dataset for testing robustness.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning techniques to predict key metrics like shipping volumes and route efficiency.
- **Visualization**: Creates charts and graphs to highlight data trends and model results.
- **Model Evaluation**: Benchmarks model accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

## Dataset
The dataset includes key variables from the maritime shipping industry, such as:
- Shipping routes
- Freight volumes
- Fuel consumption
- Operational costs

For privacy reasons, the dataset is not included in this repository. If you wish to access the data, please refer to the [Dataset Documentation](#).
